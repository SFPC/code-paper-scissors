## What's the story behind your name?
The inaugural session for the course began with one simple ask...which warranted some complicated answers...but led to some beautiful bonding moments. I've never done this icebreaker before but it was really fun learning the origins of everyone's names! Also a great way to stick names to faces, albeit difficult to remember everyone's. :)

## What is poetic computation?
There is more to computation than function, there is design and aesthetics. When we look at Peter Halley's "Instant City," we can see a transistor or an 8-bit RAM. Life imitates art and art can imitate microprocessors.

>Computation has alawys been complicit to the military industrial complex.

Computers have always been war machines, even the Internet began from military computers. This is important context as we think about the work we make.

## PAPER

As Robby, Kelli, and Coralie went through their presentations and gave us their respective histories and gave intros to the lessons we will explore, I mushed my hands into clay to make a dodecahedron (a shape with twelve flat pentagonal faces).

## Cool things I learned
- What a hexaflexagon is
- We have a 10-based counting system because we have 10 fingers on our hands
- PRINTABLE electronics are a thing
- It's possible to get better at your craft/passion by making the SUBJECT something you HATE
- How to make a MOBIUS STRIP
- Paper has a binary memory (creased or uncreased)

## Some thoughts...
I'm looking forward to exploring paper arts as a bridge between the sensory world and technology. I've always felt a strong connection to paper, making collages and zines in my free time and posting stop motion animations online when I felt inspired. It is a method that I haven't come back to in a while. I'm curious and excited to colearn with everyone and see how everybody's different skillsets / experiences will bounce off each other.
