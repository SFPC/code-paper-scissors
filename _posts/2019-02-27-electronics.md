# A taste of electric currents

Did you know, that if you lick a 9V battery you can tell if it is charged or not? The tongue has about 7 kilo-ohms resistance, which means when licking a battery you’ll have about 1-2 milliamps flowing through your mouth. You will feel this as a tingling sensation. (More info in this highly instructive [Spark Fun Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhSW_5iuy5k).


I am telling you this, because Day 9 in Code, Paper, Scissors was all about electronics. Our instructors [Coralie Gourguechon](https://www.coraliegourguechon.fr/) and [Pamela Liou](http://pamelaliou.com/index.html) are both interdisciplinary designers, who research how to demystify technology.

Most people interact with technology and electricity on a daily basis. For the vast majority of us our gadgets are are shiny black boxes. Press a button. Expect an outcome. Plug into a socket. Recharge. Repeat. Despite the best effort of our high school physics teachers, the complex inner workings of these gizmos remain obscure. 

According to Coralie understanding how technology works was her motivation to start building [Speakers](https://blog.adafruit.com/2014/05/20/coralie-gourguechon-anatomical-board-of-a-speaker-arttuesday/) and [User Interfaces](https://www.coraliegourguechon.fr/Paper-User-Interfaces) from Paper. These devices are simplified to their core functions. What do we need to amplify soundwaves? Or to have electricity go from point A to point B and light an LED on the way? The design is determined by visualizing the functionality rather than hiding it. 

## Understanding the basics

Electricity is understood as the flow of electric charge. The electrons in an atom carry negative charge. Depending on the charge and the resulting electrostatic force of atoms, the outermost electrons are attracted or repelled and can flow between atoms. Some materials do this easier (conductors like copper) than others (insulators like rubber). If charges are in constant flow we have an electric current. If you are looking for a more detailed description of electricity I can recommend our [homework reading assignment](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/what-is-electricity/all).

## Let it flow 

Our first goal is to create a circuit, which is “a closed, never-ending loop of conductive material” according to the aforementioned Spark-Fun article. Energy sources like batteries will influence the atoms in our circuit. While the negative terminal pushes the electrons, the positive attracts them and thus creates the necessary flow of electrons. This circuit can be as simple as attaching the legs of a LED diode to the correct terminals of a button battery. 

Since this course focuses on paper electronics our modules don’t end at wires and alligator clips. To create circuits on paper we work with copper tape, painting conductive and resistive inks and drawing with conductive pens. We experiment with creating parallel and series circuits first to understand how resistance builds up in materials and how electric flow can be directed.

When we – the students – are asked to create a circuit with a switch the input from the previous lessons arises in the form of the most beautiful cross-pollinations: circuits can be broken and closed by the means of pop-up books and paper engineering. Origami-dimmers can be created by changing the folds of paper that is coated with resistive ink.

Having their guts out in the open, it is surprisingly easy to interact with these electronics on
a trial and error basis: are the poles connected in the right way? Am I creating a short circuit? How do i re-establish connection, when the tape won’t hold and my circuit brakes? How do I make these damn electrons flow in the direction I want to? These circuits seem amazingly fragile and i start appreciating the black, protective boxes they come in.

## What’s next

While we are meddling with our basic circuits Coralie and Pam open up a new world to us. Apart from the more sophisticated origami circuits they are working on:

– there is a myriad of ways to apply our new skills: conductive paint can be screen-printed. Circuits can be neatly designed in Illustrator and laser-cut from copper sheets, we can use the conductivity of fruit to create  [banana pianos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbkw0LFVZDI).
Some of these, we will explore in the coming lessons (fingers crossed for fruit pianos). 

Thinking of all these possibilities definitely gave me a tingling sensation and I hope this is not just because i licked one too many batteries. 

P.S.:
Out of legal obligations I want to dissuade you from licking your battery for many reasons. Using a multimeter to check the voltage of your battery has many advantages, one of them is that you mouth won’t taste like electric charge.
