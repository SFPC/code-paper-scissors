## "???": a memoir

There is a rhythm to getting to SFPC. Leave work, speed-walk 20+ blocks, and—like a moth—shuffle towards the warm glowing light emitting from the classroom windows. I'm a few yards away from class tonight and all I see ahead of me is the cold, dark courtyard ahead. Lights out, no one in sight. Is it possible I missed a snow day memo? But the door's propped open, so I walk in and see...giant garbage bags blocking the classroom entrance and windows. ???


## Camera Obscura

Turns out, class is NOT cancelled. Kelli just transformed it into a camera obscura! Which Magic Schoolbus episode am I in right now?

We shut the lights off and huddle behind a white board by the window to see the light refracted from the courtyard outside the window. I've never taken a class in a camera but there's a first time for everything.

Kelli goes over the basic techinical functions of a camera and a little bit of its history. In my notes, I wrote:

>box with hole + film = camera obscura

I love math!

## Some things I learned:

- Glue clogs and spills on people so put a cap on it
- All camera obscura photos show as upside down because it's refracting light
- Artist Zoe Leonard converted a room into a camera obscura using a window on the fourth floor of [The Whitney](https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2014/05/whitney.jpg)
