Hi! My name is Katrin. I am an information designer working in New York City. Originally from Austria, I studied visual communications at Die Angewandte in Vienna and KADK in Copenhagen. 

Whenever possible, I take my work off-screen and collaborate with others across disciplines. My interest in the social impact of design and technology has inspired work like the NYCxDesign panel "Telling Women’s Stories with Data", "Graphic design for the Real World", a paper in Artifact Journal, and the "Manhattan Treemap" for NYC Open Data Week.

### Léonard Roussel

![Léonard]({{ "assets/students/Léonard.jpg" | relative_url }}){:.profile-image}

Hi I'm Léo (full name Léonard Roussel, moved here from Europe in 2016). I am an acoustic and audiovisual engineer with the firm Arup in New York City (open invitation to come check our SoundLab in FiDi by the way), and sound designer. At Arup I study the behavior of sound in architectural spaces and urban environments, and design solutions to optimize the auditory experience in these environments. I also collaborate on multimedia art installations (usually involving 3D sound) and would love for the art stuff I do to rely less on pure software and involve more tangible elements.
