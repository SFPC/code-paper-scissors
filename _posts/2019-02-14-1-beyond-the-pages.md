# Beyond the Pages

If you would have to draw a dot at the intersection of art school and Kindergarten, it would be labeled: Pop-up Books. Which is, what we will be working with today.

But, today's instructor, [Simon Arzipe](http://www.simonarizpe.com/) – Paper Engineer and Illustrator – instantly takes away our illusion that Pop-Ups are entirely children's business. He shows us his [*Wild-Pop-Up Book*](http://www.simonarizpe.com/#/the-wild/) – a pop-up hexaflexagon telling the endless story of a salmon being eaten by a bear. It is not just in the permanent collections of very serious adult museums like the *Smithsonian Cooper Hewitt Design Library* and the *library of the School of Visual Arts*, but – according to Simon – it also makes children cry. 

Simon perfected his craft working at the studios of [Robert Sabuda] (http://www.robertsabuda.com/) and [Matthew Reinhart] (http://www.matthewreinhart.com/pop-up-templates/). If you want to make your own valentine's card or bring your nephew to tears by making Frankenstein's monster pop out of two pages: Both studios feature great instructions on their website.

In this session, we will be covering basic pop-up mechanisms and creating our own textbook. We learn that, once these are mastered it is mostly about playing with perspective and proportion. 

Every Pop-Up mechanism needs a carrier: a base page. Choosing a paper that offers a good balance between stiffness and flexibility is a good start (Simon's recommendation is 110lb). We fold our sheet "hamburger style" (There is also hot-dog style and as later introduced by non-meat eaters "veggie-burger" style) and we are ready to start adding Pop-Up Elements:

## 1. The V-Fold:

It is a piece of angled paper, creased down the middle. Align the crease along the spine of your page. Tape – enjoy having a V-shaped piece of paper coming at you every time you open and close your page. 

The *Off-Center V-Fold* works similarly, except – as the name suggests – it is off- center. So we form a paper-cone, rotate it slightly and then add the crease by folding the page.

"Layering V-Folds on top of each other"

If you don't want your Pop-up element to stick out over the edges of your book: trim them when your page is closed. You will notice that this will change the shape of your V-Fold depending on, at which height it is situated.

And now, it is playtime: Wherever a fold and two straight edges converge is an opportunity to place a V-Fold. How about turning it upside down? Or layering them on top of each other? Draw on them, or cut them into into shapes that cast interesting shadows? Or turn them into a frog-shaped face with a tongue sticking out like this one:

V-Folds are effective for creating motion and interesting dynamics. If you're looking to maximize the space you have on your page, your new best friends are: 

## 2. Layers

To create a layer cut a strip of paper. Simon directs us to cut a piece that is about 4x2 inches. Align the crease to the spine of your page and tape the sides (while avoiding to tape down the corners). Just like with V-Folds, there are also Off-Center Layers: Tape an unfolded strip of paper slightly off center from the gutter. Gently close your book and see where your layer 'wants' to fold. Reinforce that crease.

Another variety would be the *tented layer*: Fold your layer down the middle, tape one side to your base page, and tape the backside of the other edge, so the sticky side of the tape shows up. Close your book, so the tape sticks to the page and once you open it: You should have a tented layer. Yes – we could have calculated that, but sometimes paper does math for you.

"Centered and Off-Center Layer

Speaking of math – If you have a close look at the ratio of the sides of the layers and their footprints on the page you might see that, while the sides of the centered layers and their footprints are equal, lengths of sides and footprints for the off-center layer are mirrored. As much as pop-up books seem all play and pony farm, understanding construction principles like these are crucial to design more complex narratives that fold flat and stay within the edges of your book.

These observations fit neatly into my personal theme of Code, Paper, Scissors so far: Play and think. Your material, in our case paper comes with an inherent logic, possibilities and limitations. There are intuitive ways for understanding it – in fact playing with it, is the most straightforward way to gain the tacit knowledge that you need to successfully work "with" and not "against" the material. Then, add some intellectual reflection and the explicit knowledge of capable teachers on top and you have a holistic and delightful way of creating knowledge.

Lucky us, this way of learning came with a just as delightful textbook that covers the basic principles of pop-up engineering: 

Of course, our books don't come close to any of these [Masterpieces] https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2018/10/alphabet-popup-book/ – but understanding the underlying mechanics makes studying the work of paper-engineers, that have graduated kindergarten, even more rewarding.
