# The Origin of Symmetry

(A blogpost about origami by someone who apparently spend her teenage years listening to Muse)

In Physics the Theory of Supersymmetry is a view of the universe, where “everything is symmetric and beautiful” Michael Peskin, theorist at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. [Source](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-supersymmetry-dead/)

Devoid of high tech equipment like supercolliders, we – the students in “Code, Paper, Scissors” at SFPC – are trying to access this wisdom by other means: mastering the art of origami.

The idea that origami is a way to relate to math and therefore to the underlying geometry of our universe might be me trying to upsell what, at the moment, looks like 17 persons distorting paper and their faces in deep concentration. But it is also an idea I came across watching ["The Origami Revolution"](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/video/the-origami-revolution/).

It is not by chance, that a lot of very interesting origami work is done by mathematicians like [Robert Lang](https://langorigami.com/) and that NASA engineers are looking at folding mechanisms found in origami, to design solar panels for space missions.

In this introduction class, the origin of everything that is symmetrical is definitely our teacher [Robby Kraft](https://www.instagram.com/gridpaper/?hl=en).

We start out by learning basic principles of origami art:

Folding Axioms like aligning points, or edges. Techniques for mountain, valley, outside-reverse or rabbit-ear folds, and most importantly: we learn that understanding these principles is just half the rent. The other half is sensing the paper, understanding the grain and structure. Feeling where folds create tension, directions and start sensing where the paper wants to go. Because surprise: it is rarely the direction YOU want it to go.

The more I understand this, the more i like the idea of our paper squares as small universes: Possibly because it allures to my god-complex, hopefully just because I like designing systems. Decisions taken in on corner of the paper will have impact of what happens in the other corner. When you do it right you will have beautiful patterns and revelations. Suddenly, crease lines align and trigger small ‘AHA’-orgasm in your brain. 
Inhabiting your small paper universe is living in a world where everything exists for a reason; everything makes sense. (A very soothing feeling if you live in a city like New York.)

According to Robby finding these confirmation points is a sign of great origami design and the first step of understanding and possibly designing our own crease patterns.
To be honest – right now I have no idea how this square diagram of solid and dotted lines will end up as the bug that Robby is just showing us. Which, by the way, looks realistically enough for me to fight the urge to take off my shoe and squash it.

To explain how a square can end up as a bug with four very long spindly and slightly unsettling legs, Robby folds a piece of fabric, demonstrating how to allocate material, how to divide angles and pack them in circles. This exercise also gives us an idea how the material behaves when pulled at certain points. We see how it spreads and folds naturally and how we can use this to our advantage to work with rather than against it. 

For everyone not sharing my enthusiasm for precise, mathematical creases in paper there is good news: there is a more intuitive, sculptural approach to shaping paper. There is also bad news: getting that intuition will take more than playing around with origami for 1½ hours.

Again, fabric helps us grasp the basic processes at a bigger level. This time wrapped tightly around a hat: Where is excess material, how do we tuck it away, what kind of pleats happen on their own and how can we ‘clean them up’ and use them for our work? The goal: Sculptural Paper Masks following the work of Eric Joisel. Instead of asking the big questions to the universe like before, we’re having other important issues like: “Do faces REALLY need eyes? I don’t know” (Leo)

Turns out molding paper into concave shapes is rather tricky. But tricky also means, there are tricks to it: spraying the paper with water for example. Wet paper might be more prone to ripping, but it is easier to mold and once it is dried it will retain that shape. Considering the shape my mask is in right now, I’m not sure this is a good thing.

Since the theory of supersymmetry claims that every particle has a counterpart, I like to believe that somewhere, there is a version of me folding the counterpart to my mask (a.k.a one that doesn’t look like crap). Maybe this version of me is not somewhere else in space, but in time? If so, she might be in the future and I’ll find out next week.

Until then I’ll be busy phoning my my high school math teacher, asking why she never thought of explaining geometry to me by folding triangles.
