# The Origin of Symmetry

In Physics, the *Theory of Supersymmetry* is a view of the universe in which “everything is symmetric and beautiful”, to quote from Michael Peskin, theorist at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. [source](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-supersymmetry-dead/)

Devoid of high tech equipment like supercolliders, we the students in “Code, Paper, Scissors” at SFPC, are trying to access this wisdom by other means – like mastering the art of origami.

The idea that origami is a way to relate to math, and therefore to the underlying geometry of our universe, might be me trying to upsell what, in a moment, could seem like 17 persons distorting paper and their faces in deep concentration. But I lend it some credence; it is also an idea I came across while watching ["The Origami Revolution"](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/video/the-origami-revolution/).

It is not by chance. Mathematicians like [Robert Lang](https://langorigami.com/), and furthermore, NASA engineers, are looking at origami folding mechanisms to design solar panels for space missions.

In this introductory class, the origin of everything that is symmetrical is definitely our teacher [Robby Kraft](https://www.instagram.com/gridpaper/?hl=en).

We started out by learning basic principles of origami art – the underlying “Axioms” of the medium. In addition, we folded our way through a vocabulary lesson: mountain fold, valley fold, outside-reverse or rabbit-ear folds. Most importantly, we learn that understanding these principles “is just half the rent”. We must also sense  the paper, understand its grain, its structure. We must sense where folds create tension; we must sense where the paper wants to go. Because, surprise! It is rarely in the direction YOU want it to go.

The more I understand this, the more I like the idea of our paper squares as small universes: Possibly because it is alluring to my god-complex, hopefully just because I like designing systems. Decisions made at one corner of the paper contribute to the state of the other corner. Successes come in the forms of beautiful patterns and revelations. Suddenly, crease-lines align and trigger small ‘AHA’-orgasm in the brain. To inhabit your small paper universe is to live in a world where everything exists for a reason, and everything makes sense (a very soothing feeling if you live in a city like New York).

According to Robby, finding these confirmation points is a sign of great origami design and the first step toward a greater understanding – and possibly to designing our own crease patterns. To be honest, right now I have no idea how this square diagram of solid and dotted lines will end up as the bug that Robby just showed us. A bug which, by the way, looks realistic enough for me to need to fight the urge to take off my shoe and squash it.

To explain how a square can end up as a bug with four very long spindly and slightly unsettling legs, Robby folded a piece of fabric. This exercise demonstrated how to allocate material, how to divide angles, and how to pack them in circles. Working with fabric helped develop a more intuitive understanding of the way material behaves when pulled at certain points. We see how it spreads and folds naturally and how we can use this to our advantage; to work with rather than against.

For everyone without my enthusiasm for precise, mathematical creases in paper, I have good news: there exists another, more intuitive, sculptural approach to shaping paper. There is also bad news: getting that intuition will take more than playing around with origami for 1½ hours.

Again, fabric helps us grasp the basic processes at a bigger level. This time wrapped tightly around a hat, it asks: Where is excess material? How do we tuck it away? What kind of pleats happen on their own and how can we ‘clean them up’ and use them for our work? The goal: Sculptural Paper Masks, following the work of Eric Joisel. Instead of asking the big questions of the universe like before, we’re having other important issues like: “Do faces REALLY need eyes? I don’t know” (Leo)

It turns out molding paper into concave shapes is rather tricky. But tricky also means, “there are tricks to it”, such as spraying the paper with water. Wet paper might be more prone to ripping, but it is easier to mold, and once dried, it will retain its shape. Considering the shape my mask is in right now, I’m not sure this is a good thing.

Since the theory of supersymmetry claims that every particle has a counterpart, I like to believe that somewhere, there is a version of me folding the counterpart to my mask (i.e. one that doesn’t look like crap). Maybe this version of me is not somewhere else in space, but in time? If so, she might be in the future and I’ll find out next week.

Until then I’ll be busy phoning my my high school math teacher, asking why she never thought of explaining geometry to me by folding triangles.
