Hi I'm Léo (full name Léonard Roussel, moved here from Europe in 2016).

At Arup I study the behavior of sound in architectural spaces and urban environments, and design solutions to optimize the auditory experience in these environments. I also collaborate on multimedia art installations (usually involving 3D sound) and would love for the art stuff I do to rely less on pure software and involve more tangible elements.
