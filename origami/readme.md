# crease patterns

all crease patterns are either:

- shared by the author (from their website/flickr) possibly converted/vectorized here.
- reverse-engineered from looking at their folded form

David Huffman's work was reverse-engineered by [Demaine/Demaine/Koschitz](http://erikdemaine.org/papers/Huffman_Origami5/paper.pdf)
